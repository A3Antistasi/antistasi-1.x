* Change Petros model to FIA Indipendent and HQ marker to indipendent colour
* Delete all playable units and replace them with Indipendent ones
* Rememebr to rename the player to "comandante" and link it to the High Command

* Manage to create a road-database
* Adapt Sparker roadblock function
* Have enough base defending territories
