Pew Configuration file.
-----------------------

If detected, a Pew Configuration file is meant to set items like color and natural or artificial objects to a desirable outcome.
Wrp files do not contain this information, and output to pew sets all objects to 'natural' by default (since plants are by far the largest 
quantity of 'objects' on an island).

By default, .cfg extension unless specified otherwise on command line;


You can have a default configuration file or a special, or none at all.

if a config file is specified on the command line. That file predominates.

If none specified:

The exe looks for a default configuration file in the same folder as the wrp.

The default name is, EITHER, the NameOfWrp.cfg,,, OR, a more generalised 'Pew.cfg'
If both exist, the NameOfWrp.cfg predominates.

If neither exist, the exe looks for a default file in the 'current directory' which is not necessarily that of the wrp.

If no config file is found, the exe sets it's own default values. Specifically, all objects are set to 'natural'.

An example Pew.Cfg is contained in this package
