fixed an embarrasing error with config.bin
5.22
rapify:

rtm: wrote rtm5's correctly
p3d: removed masstag requirement for p3d's

config.cpp. requiredaddons[]= must now have non-blank ("") entries, or nothing at all (when appropriate)
improved make/extract pbo error messages
dertm: new format accounted for

5.10
added jpg to file type list

5.09

4.72
rapify: speed increase by removing memory mallocs
4.71  removed acceptance of ebo files for extraction. AGAIN!
(it snuck back in)

4.67
rapify: cfgPatches rebuild

fixed bug where an addon containing only a config.cpp (or one that didn't require bis binarise eg no p3d or wrp) did not 
rebuild the cfgpatches class.

added error message if a config.cpp does not have a cfgpatches and no addon name can be created. it will generally fail
regardless because of lack of a requiredAddons, which the dll would be unable to determine.


auto deletion of classes stated in an array but doesn't actually exist.


changed rebuild to only build if there is one (not multiple), cfgpatches


4.66
removed ebo as a 'pbo' file when doing folder scans because i can't process them for arma3p

4.65

array+= in configs is now accepted as a binarised value in the engine. 
previously the dll would encode it (for lint checking purposes) then supply a config.cpp in a pbo because the engine could not.

4.64

p3d's

revised extractmodelcfg to account for moved goalposts in Arma3

4.63
detex: revised debug traps to be less strict

4.62
wrp scans
added scan p3d only to speed up pboproject

4.61

re-enabled new mapinfo types for arma3. no idea why they were crippled

4.60
fixed memleak/ erronenous sha sig for huge mem model
4.59
fixed huge mem pbo extraction AGAIN!

4.58
steam tools:
 fixed by avoiding bis anything so far as humanly possible.

makepbo: changed wording from merged to igoored or merged when dealing with .dep,.h and other excluded from the pbo, files

4.57

4.56
added inconsequential io_rmdir() for subsequent use by movefolder exe and pboproject, when, i get round to them

4.55
dewss: added deOgg vorbis sound module
this requires a secondary download of deogg.dll
upgraded moveobject to prevent preceding slashes
rapid/derap: significant speed improvements to both

4.54
modified dewss code

4.53

added api functionality for drive changes

4.46
rapify: eof early truncation means lack of }; even for ofp
extractpbo: huge memory: fixed

4.45
rapify: now errors when array[]{what,ever,}; (the trailing comma)
makepbo:
	added detection of a prefix file, with, a prefix= for pboProject
	source\* is now totally excluded

4.44
makepbo:extractpbo:
$pboprefix$.txt no longer produces the kegetys first line. prefix= is produced instead
altering the prefix is not recommended as this conflicts with external file checking

4.43
rapify:
1) added detection for 'true' and 'false' which do not exist and mistakenly produce strings. the user was supposed to #define these values
but bis altis also has this issue because bis themselves forgot to define them and the resulting value is wrongly, a string. On decode, everyone is copying this 'wrong' value.
2) put back missing semi-colon detection.

dep3d: minor alteration to better detect if there is, in fact, any changes in type59 from type58's

4.42
dep3d type59 to 58 conversion

4.35
prepatory work for 64 bit
moveobject: added functions to strip hard path and drive
depew: more verbose diagnostic of when it fails
check3d externals, provided more verbose reason that 'no file found' when p3d being analyzed has been corrupted
'missing files' now stop immediately for easier at-a-glance, fixing
incorporated eliteness rap sha's into read and write encoding in the dll, not, eliteness
removed all eliteness sha generation and moved to common dll routines
corrected p3d filename returns to ignore #default in bisurf
4.34
rap: returns error on attempt to open a non-text file

4.30
extractpbo
removed deprecated api function calls
4.29
filetreeEX: (internal)
movefolder:
	minor fix to comparing null filestrings.
4.28
released in error as 4.27 but 4.27 was never released so no harm done
DeRap:
reverted real bad decision to use single line output for arrays
added more linux specific, clang compiler sensitive changes

4.23
rapify:
corrected for sqx """"" argument in some missions

added callback progress text to texheader analaysis

4.16
wrp:
added type12 mapinfo construct for ifa islands

4.15
rapify:
fixed error in detecting sound files for missions
removed file checking of anything with spaces as being more likely to be a text string
fixed array[]={blah missingComma blah};
makepbo:
removed the need for noproxy flag
the dll now checks if class=man exists and if so doesn't fuss over non existent proxy.p3d's
class man should be in the geolod but sometimes isn't

changed prefix file name from pboprefix.txt to $PBOPREFIX$.txt

added functions to filestringEx

makepbo:
made more descriptive 'what's happening' text to stdio
4.12
dertm:

Debinarising:
O2 must have the exact name to work. The lowercase bones in the skeleton in both the p3d and the binarised rtm is useless.
Replaced lower case only binarised rtm bone names with the 'correct' mixed case model.cfg (when supplied)
Supplying a binarised p3d is useful but wont work for above.
2) improved decoding of skeleton model.cfg's (or any other name including a .h)
there can be a range of skeletons in this cfg, the dll will match the correct one against the rtm





4.11
added debinarising code for rtm files

4.10 general release

general:

removed windows Unicode as unacceptable and replaced with utf8.
provided more consistent acceptance of folder path specifications
specifically, unc\\: and <drive>: (current dir)

4.09d: released to milkman/bad benson

provided code for mat14.exe (and arma3 alpha island maker)

new api functions for gui apps needing the dll

4.06b
CreatePbo
vbs:
fixed sometimes erroneous file.pbo.xbo to file.xbo

(if they ever exist)
ditto comment for vbs lite encryptions

4.05
whoops fixed write error when converting a3 odols
4.04

fixed small problem with cwc pbo's (bug introduced at 4.01)

preliminary release of a3 type 56 decoding

improved type58 p3d decoding

	now, convertp3d, extractmodelcfg, and eliteness work for all seen p3d's so far


4.03
preliminary release of arma3 p3d type58 odol decoding.
4.02

3. small inconsequential memleak removed

vista vs xp:

re-enabled xp compatibility in registry calls

fixed missing 1st letter of a proxy filepath for p3d's in dayZ objects

changed silly error message (out of memory) when rapify cannot opena file, to no file found (duh)

fixed bad status value when deleting last item in a chain causing (rapify especially) to error out on last #include or last #undef

3.99 final
public release
3.99e
internal:

fixed rather nasty error in chain deletion where nchains retained old size
very few exe's made use of this feature

merged whisperofp's linux 64bit platform

3.99d released to wolle and sep to snakeman for createpewobjects

extractpbo:
more work on ofp headers saying they are compressed and they aren't

rapify:
improved eval parser (again) for kju

3.99c
rapify:
fixed evals to ignore math + string expressions (eg 10+ cos 31) and pass as is because they often contain undecodable sqX
but, any attempt to output the binary produces error. this is a lint checker

allowed implied rap extensions of .cpp/hpp/h

3.99b
released to Q
fixed eval decoding
added implied directory searches for external file references
allowed all raw form files as equivalent to binarised form. wss or ogg output == wav, paa output =tga or png

3.99b released to wolle
extractpbo:
fixed early cwc compressed pbo detection (has no 1st hdr)

rapify:
allowed tga/png files in external reference checks.
extractpbo:
pboPrefix.txt now produces full header of pbo. First line of which happens to be the prefix making it compatible with
existing format (not compatible with old kegs tools (cPbo probably) )

makepbo:
changed pbo creation to addon type if -J enabled and no mission.sqm or config.cpp detected
fixed a small possibility of mis-detection if unbinarised p3d discovered

3.99a released to kju
3.98 included for public use
internal:
Str dup: fixed potential error collision of duping same string (was fixed, then broke at some point)
stderr messages now ensure lf endings for dos console and crlf for windows gui outputs
Rapify:
changed erroneous 'unicode error' to a warning that the filesize of a text file is not the same as the amount
of characters in that file. This can occur from badly coded block f writes to disk by the application that wrote the file. 
It is an indication of file corruption.

makepbo:
rapid scan for unbin p3d. this to stop a multiple pass batch file where it first attempts to makepbo, then finds it needs binarise but does another makepbo to lintcheck
the need to do so is skipped since the dll will lintcheck everything and then ultimately, return bad (p3d) status if it finds nothing else to report

small esoteric fix to creating true vbslite mission.pbo's which *might* be mis-detected if the missions are in fact an addon
added png to default exclude list.
added .xxx folders to default exclude lst
prevented scans of .xxx folders (even from command line) MakePbo .git eg
prevented scans of excluded folders (and files)
added optional command line exclude list

	won't accept a tga/png reference if making pbo
	will accept the following for the -Q (lint only) option
	p3d wants tga
		tga/pac/paa found
	p3d wants png
		png/pac/paa found
	p3d wants paa
		paa/tga/png found
	p3d wants pac
		pac/tga/png found

	the assumption being that the pax will be built or is already built and the p3d name will change accordingly

linux:  minor fixup-garantee for readtextfiles() to ensure linux compatibility


3.75
wrp: unused layer references cause errors in arma wrps and warnings-only for ofp.
this, because, the user can fix arma issues, but ofp faults are legacy.

note that any variants of __EVAL or __EXEC that are using (or calling) sqX are only Lintable for general syntax. They *cannot* be processed by the dll and therefore should only be in description.ext. They will be processed out of existence if binararised into a mission.sqm or config.cpp, and whatever they were intended to do, will be lost.

3.25
substantially altered dll ap interface to try and, finally, stop incompatibility issues on each realease of the dll
this is a structural change to prevent crashes. in theory, altering the rapify module should not affect a completlely unrelated sound module. it has, in the past, due to the way that microsoft build their dll;s

3.15
odolv50 (baf pbo's) or oa patch 1.54
