# Antistasi: An Arma III Guerilla simulator

It's a persistent mission designed for semi-randomized asymmetric warfare designed by The Author **Barbolani**. Fight dirty, ambush or deliver supplies to convince Altis civilians to join your cause. Get support from NATO depending on your behaviour and beware of CSAT that will support AAF or eventually napalm cities if you gain too much control over AAF military emplacements.
Operate Undercover or raid along your fellows by recruiting AI and garrisons or simply join your friends in multiplayer with the possibility to load the best mods of Arma3 community.

# Credits

After 1.2 *Chris* coded many changes under the supervision of *RickyTan* and *Kendo* with the contribution of *Toshi* and *Tucks* for porting and templates.

After 1.7.6 *Sparker* and *Jeroen* continued because the 1.7 bugs weren't possible to be fixed unless changing a lot of the code. 

*Stef* started supervising since 1.7.17 with great help of *IrLED* who started the github project and coded major core fixes and improvement such as proportional distribution of AI to headlessclients,lightened spawned script etc.

*Triada* adapted the mission for multi-language translation updating Stringtable.xml and harmonizing hints and task display. He translated, with support of Russian community, the mission to Russian. Also, *Nemesti* added the Spanish translation.

*Stef* is continuing, with precious *Sparker'* help. 

We're looking for more coders, every contribution is appreciated!

# Modding Antistasi

We look for coders and we'll credit you for your contributions indeed!
However, if you wish to make your own modification, you can but **you must credit Barbolani** as Author.
Consider the complexity of this mission and the high goal of persistency; Arma engine has important limitation so we can't do whatever we desire, there are always bollenecks here and there.
