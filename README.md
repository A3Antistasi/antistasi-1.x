# Antistasi: An Arma III Guerilla simulator

It's a persistent mission designed for semi-randomized asymmetric warfare.
This is the developing version, many progress have been done since 1.7 however we aren't ready for a release.



The Author is **Barbolani**

After 1.2 *Chris* coded many changes under the supervision of *RickyTan* and *Kendo* with the contribution of *Toshi* and *Tucks* for porting and templates.

After 1.7.6 *Sparker* and *Jeroen* continued because the 1.7 bugs weren't possible to be fixed unless changing a lot of the code. 

Currently: *Stef* is supervising the project and coding some simple stuff, *IrLED* started coding major fixes and improvement since 1.7.17, he also organized the github environment.

We're looking for more coders, every contribution is appreciated!

\Change faction or island\ rename the mission you want to "mission.sqm" copy and paste into AntistasiOfficial.Altis

In case you change world also rename the folder to .worldname.
