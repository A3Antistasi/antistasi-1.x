# Discontinued project

In over a year this project added many features which are not as functional as it is the [current Antistasi](https://github.com/A3Antistasi/Antistasi-WotP), the official community discontinued this project in favor of the other.

# Credits

After 1.2 *Chris* coded many changes under the supervision of *RickyTan* and *Kendo* with the contribution of *Toshi* and *Tucks* for porting and templates.

After 1.7.6 *Sparker* and *Jeroen* continued because the 1.7 bugs weren't possible to be fixed unless changing a lot of the code. 

*Stef* started supervising since 1.7.17 with great help of *IrLED* who started the github project and coded major core fixes and improvement such as proportional distribution of AI to headlessclients,lightened spawned script etc.

*Triada* adapted the mission for multi-language translation updating Stringtable.xml and harmonizing hints and task display. He translated, with support of Russian community, the mission to Russian. Also, *Nemesti* added the Spanish translation.

*Stef*, Wurzel0701 and Zalexki continued the develop branch untill Barbolani released the current A3-Antistasi

# Mods

The mission has no dependencies, however it can detect the following mods.
* **CBA**, **TFAR**, RHS-**AFRF**+**GREF**(replace AAF, CSAT), RHS-**USAF**(replace NATO), **ACE**, **inidibi2**(multiple saves).

Client side mods, as long they don't affect AI, are generally ok. Here's some suggestions
* Dusty retexture project, JSRS, Enhanced Movement, Blastcore

# Continuing this project 

You can take files and modify at will, you won't be allowed to sign it as official, nor this version will be loaded on Official Servers
Consider the complexity of this mission and the high goal of persistency; Arma engine has important limitation so we can't do whatever we desire, there are always bollenecks here and there.
