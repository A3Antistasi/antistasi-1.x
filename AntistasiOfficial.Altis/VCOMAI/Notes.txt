Static Weapon Notes:

So far Vanilla bags contain their proper "assembleInfo" information as seen below
Here is the pathway example
configfile >> "CfgVehicles" >> "B_GMG_01_high_weapon_F" >> "assembleInfo" >> "assembleTo"
and then the result
assembleTo = "B_GMG_01_high_F";

RHS example
configfile >> "CfgVehicles" >> "RHS_SPG9_Tripod_Bag" >> "assembleTo"
assembleTo = "rhs_SPG9_INS";

With this we should be able to dynamically pull the classnames of bags and assign them to units. This way they can dynamically use any appropriately modded static bag.
There is also dissasembleTo[] = {}; to consider. This can be used to figure out what bag an AI unit should recieve.
